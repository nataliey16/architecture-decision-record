## Summary

### Issues

  * Navigation Strategy: Choosing an approach that balances easy access to main sections and deeper navigation within each section.
  * Handle real-time updates: Ensuring smooth data flow between screens without compromising app performance.

### Decision

  * Navigation choice: We decided on a nested navigation structure, with Tab Navigation for high-level sections and Stack Navigation within each tab for in-depth navigation.

### Status

  * Current Status: Nested navigation using tabs and stacks has been chosen and implemented as the navigation strategy.



## Details

### Assumptions

  * We aim to create a flexible platform where users can switch between main features while exploring each feature in depth.
  * Navigation needs to support efficient transitions within each main section while maintaining a user-friendly structure.

### Constraints

  * Ensuring smooth performance as users switch between tabs and navigate within sections.
  * Providing a consistent and intuitive experience on both Android and iOS platforms.

### Positions

  * **Nested Navigation with Tabs and Stacks:** Weâ€™ll use `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` for main tabs (e.g., Home, Vision Board, Widgets) and Stack Navigation within each tab for detailed screens.
  * **Backend Integration:** Backend setup will ensure data is available for both tab and stack navigation without disrupting the user experience.

### Argument

  * **User Experience:** Combining tabs and stacks allows users to switch seamlessly between main sections while exploring multiple layers within each section.
  * **Flexibility:** This setup is easy to expand, letting us add or remove stack screens within each tab without needing major changes.
  * **Maintainability:** Nested navigation keeps the code organized, as each main tab operates independently while being part of the larger navigation system.

### Implications

  * **Scalability:** Adding or modifying screens within each tab is straightforward.
  * **Consistent User Flow:** Nested navigation maintains user context within each tab, reducing the need for repeated navigation setup.
  * **Performance:** This approach minimizes unnecessary re-renders and maintains a smooth experience even with real-time data updates.
